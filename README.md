########## WHY? ##########

I only bothered to create this because the tool that my significant other used to use for this job stopped working. It isn't perfect, but I wrote it in about an hour and it works so there is that at least. :)

########## HOW? ##########

In order to use this (very basic) tool, please ensure that you have python3 (preferably 3.7+) installed.

After that, ensure that you have the required dependencies installed. They are:

    tweepy (3.10.0)
    numpy (1.19.2)

To install these on Windows issue these commands: 1. pip install tweepy==3.10.0 2. pip install numpy==1.19.2

If you're on Linux I'm assuming you know what to do, lol. :)

Let me know if this breaks for you and I'll do my best to fix it.

Happy blocking! :)
